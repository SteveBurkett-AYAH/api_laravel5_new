## The base Laravel 5 configuration for Ayah projects.

This repo provides the base configuration of Laravel 5 used for Ayah projects.  It includes customized composer files that pull in other packages to help make our code faster to develop and easier to maintain.

These packages include:

* Laravel 5 Extended Generators
* Laracasts Flash
* Illuminate/Html
* Doctrine/dbl
* Bugsnag

* http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/packages

As we make changes to this and/or the packages we create, we'll need to tag changes with version numbers to that we can easily specify (via composer) and manage which versions to use.
